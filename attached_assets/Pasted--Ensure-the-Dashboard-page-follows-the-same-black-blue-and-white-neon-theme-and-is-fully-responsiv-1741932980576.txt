"Ensure the Dashboard page follows the same black, blue, and white neon theme and is fully responsive. This page should only be accessible if a user is logged in. If a non-logged-in user tries to access it, display a neon-styled message prompting them to log in first."

Access Control & Navbar Updates:
If the user is not logged in, display a full-screen neon message:
"Please log in to use the Dashboard."
Below the message, add a glowing Login button. Clicking it redirects to the Login page.
If the user is logged in, open the Dashboard page:
The "Dashboard" tab in the navbar should glow to indicate the active page (same for the Home page).
Navbar remains the same as on the home page but now includes a profile icon with hover settings dropdown.
Dashboard Background & Responsiveness:
Continue the square grid background effect from the home page.
Ensure the grid is visible on both desktop and mobile screens.
The neon halogen light effect on the left and right sides of the page should remain.
Dashboard Sections (All Cards with Futuristic Animations & Hover Effects):
1) File Upload & Encryption Card:
A glowing neon card where users can browse and upload files (.pdf, .jpg, etc.).
Options to select:
File Selection (Choose file button).
Unlock Date Selection (Calendar input).
After selection, show the uploaded file below the selection area.
Add a button labeled "Upload & Encrypt" (For now, this button does nothing, as backend will be handled later).
Ensure a smooth opening animation when the card appears.
2) Storage Overview Card:
Show total storage used vs. available (e.g., 4GB/5GB for the Free Plan).
Display a glowing progress bar representing storage usage.
Add an animated hover effect when interacting with this section.
3) User Subscription Plan Card:
Display current plan details (e.g., Free Plan - 5GB Storage).
For testing purposes, allow switching between plans manually to see if the storage overview updates accordingly.
After testing, remove manual plan switching for real users.
4) Recent Activity Card (Large Card with Animations):
List of recently uploaded files with:
File type logo on the left (PDF, JPG, etc.).
File name and format (e.g., "Document1.pdf").
Date uploaded.
Time remaining to unlock, displayed inside a long glowing oval with a lock icon.
Add smooth animations for listing new files.
Footer:
Same as the Home page, with Terms & Conditions, Contact, etc.
This Dashboard page will have a futuristic, sleek, and user-friendly feel while keeping it responsive and visually appealing. ðŸš€
